Inspiration

Create a credit card form for submitting payments. Use either React or Vue and bundle it using either webpack or parcel and deploy it to a cloud provider of your choosing. 
If you're unsure we can recommend Netlify or Heroku. Focus should be on validation and ease of use.

Consider what we can validate / detect without making a request to the payment server.
Include unit / e2e tests
Bundle your module with webpack or parcel.
